### 6.1 Database Naming Conventions
For database design, we follow these standards:

- **Foreign Keys**: Use the primary key name only (e.g., `user_id` instead of `owner_user_id`) to enable USING in joins
- **Junction Tables**: Named by combining the two table names in alphabetical order (e.g., `user_organization`)
